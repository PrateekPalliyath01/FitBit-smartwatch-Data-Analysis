# Fitbit Smartwatch Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing Fitbit smartwatch data to uncover insights about user activity and health metrics. The analysis is performed using Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on processing and visualizing Fitbit data to understand patterns and trends related to physical activity, sleep, and heart rate. It aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data collected from the Fitbit smartwatch.

## Technologies Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling large datasets.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Data

The data used in this analysis comes from Fitbit smartwatches and includes various metrics such as:

  -ActivityDate              
  -TotalSteps                       
  -TotalDistance                  
  -TrackerDistance
